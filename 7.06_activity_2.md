# 7.06 Activity 2

- Research and discuss some potential causes of data imbalance.

- The class imbalance problem in machine/statistical learning is the observation that some binary classification(*) algorithms do not perform well when the proportion of 0 classes to 1 classes is very skewed.

- The cause of the class imbalance problem is the convention to use accuracy as a loss function. class imbalance is a problem characteristic (rare disease diagnostic for example), that can be dealt with using several strategies. Using a class weight inverse proportional to the class size when computing the loss function is one of them. 
- The main problem with imbalanced dataset prediction is how accurately are we actually predicting both majority and minority class?
