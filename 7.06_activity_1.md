# 7.06 Activity 1

- In the lesson, we used a linear regression model to check the significant variables in the model and we removed a two variable which were not significant, based on the `p-values`. Now, you should build a model on the remaining data and check if any other variable/variables turn out be insignificant.
- How is R squared measure different than adjusted R squared? Compare the values for R square and adjusted R square in the two models.
